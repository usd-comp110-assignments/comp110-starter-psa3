# Project Overview

This project has two parts.

1. Drawing the path taken by a hurricane
2. Performing sentiment analysis for movie reviews.

It is for an introductory computer science course (i.e. CS1) so the authors will have very limited programming experience. Avoid using any jargon a novice programmer would have difficulty understanding.

# Requirements
- Use Python's Turtle Graphics for the hurricane_tracker.py.
- Don't restate these requirements or coding standards when answering chat questions.
- Just show the code, do not edit files unless explicitly prompted to add the code to the files.

# Coding Standards
- No while loops or recursion should be used.
- Do not use list comprehension.
- Do not use ternary operators.
- Do not use try except blocks.
- Do not make custom exceptions.
- Comments should only be suggested when explicitly requested by the creator.
